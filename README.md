Analysis

The data shows the following:

•	Student scores in both math and reading were largely the same for Small and Medium sized schools, but dropped significantly at schools with larger student populations.
•	There is a significant difference in both average score and passing rate between charter schools and district schools with charter schools 38% higher in overall passing rate
•	Spending per student seems to be inversely related to scores and passing rate, with students receiving the most funds faring the worse in both score and passing rate.
